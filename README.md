//Pupper coin - Form from ETH

The true decentralization lies in providing control to the ultimate/legitimate user and their resources and all involved parties. If so why do we need shard chains to scale? Cant we have have "Zero/minimal knowledge Watchers" who can enforce the tamper-proof wallets to the "Beacon chain"?



Wallet 2.0 may solve the big problem , IMO or may be it's just a noise to. be ignored. Healthy competition between Wallet service providers can help the users sync their wallet to all of their multiple devices.



Watchers (Validators in ETH term) Need not to do the actual validation at all! Let the Wallet software do it for them! Watchers can be randomly grouped (Randomly chosen groups with random nodes) to question each group to ensure the security for the chain!
